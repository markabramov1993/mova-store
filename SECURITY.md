## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at Mova Store. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: security@movalabs.dev
3. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Regular updates on our progress
- Credit in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables. **Never commit secrets to the repository.**

Required environment variables are documented in `.env.local.example`. Copy this file to `.env.local` and fill in your values.

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

### Sensitive Data Handling

| Data Type            | Storage               | Notes                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Keys             | Environment variables | Never hardcode                                              |
| Supabase Config      | Environment variables | Client-side anon key is safe; never commit service role key |
| EmailJS Credentials  | Environment variables | Required for email functionality                            |
| Stellar Contract IDs | Environment variables | Public but environment-specific                             |
| User Passwords       | Supabase Auth         | Handled by Supabase, never stored locally                   |
| Payment Data         | On-chain (Stellar)    | Non-custodial, no card data stored                          |

### Smart Contract Security

The Soroban escrow contract follows security best practices:

1. **Non-custodial**: Funds flow directly from buyer to contract to merchant
2. **Access Control**: Only authorized parties can dispatch/refund orders
3. **Token Whitelist**: Only approved tokens can be used for payment
4. **Event Emission**: All state changes emit events for transparency
5. **Error Handling**: Typed errors prevent unexpected failures

### Frontend Security

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **XSS Prevention**: HTML entities are escaped before rendering
3. **HTTPS Only**: All API calls use HTTPS
4. **No Sensitive Data in URLs**: Sensitive data is sent via POST body
5. **Content Security Policy**: Configured in Next.js headers

### Authentication

- Supabase Authentication handles user sessions
- Admin access is controlled via email whitelist (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS`)
- No passwords are stored in the application

### Dependencies

- Dependencies are regularly updated for security patches
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- CI pipeline fails on high-severity vulnerabilities

## Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] No secrets or API keys are committed
- [ ] User inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] No `eval()` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] No console.log with sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side OTP Generation

The current OTP implementation generates codes client-side for demonstration purposes. In production:

- Move OTP generation to a server-side API route
- Implement rate limiting on OTP requests
- Add OTP expiration (recommended: 5 minutes)

### Card Payment Fields

The card payment form fields are UI-only placeholders. In production:

- Integrate with a PCI-compliant payment processor (Stripe, etc.)
- Never handle raw card data on your servers
- Use tokenization for card storage

### Supabase Row Level Security

Apply `supabase/schema.sql` so that:

- Anyone can read products
- Only authenticated users can write products / upload images
- Tighten policies further for production (admin-only writes)

Never expose the Supabase **service role** key in the browser.

## Stellar/Soroban Security

### Testnet vs Mainnet

- **Testnet**: Used for development, tokens have no real value
- **Mainnet**: Real value transactions, requires additional auditing

Before mainnet deployment:

1. Smart contract security audit
2. Penetration testing
3. Rate limiting implementation
4. Monitoring and alerting setup

### Wallet Security

- Users connect their own Freighter wallet
- Private keys never leave the user's browser
- Transactions require explicit user approval
